        <p style="font-size: 16px;">Hello! I’m SAHIL KUMAR MALLICK, an aspiring Java developer with a passion for
          building
          efficient
          and scalable
          applications. I recently graduated from MCA at INSTITUTE OF PROFESSIONAL STUDIES AND RESEARCH and have honed
          my
          skills in Java programming, object-oriented design, and software development practices.

          I enjoy solving complex problems and translating them into elegant code. My journey began when I took
          admission in INSTITUTE OF PROFESSIONAL STUDIES AND RESEARCH, where I learned the fundamentals of <b>JAVA
            PROGRAMMING and OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN.</b> I gained experience in developing.I specialize in Java and its
          frameworks, such as Spring and JavaServer Faces (JSF), which I use to build robust back-end systems. I’m also
          familiar with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to create responsive and
          interactive user interfaces. My goal is to bridge the gap between front-end and back-end development to
          deliver complete web solutions.
        </p>

      <div>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;"> I love tackling challenges and continuously learning new technologies and tools in
          the ever-evolving web development landscape. I believe that good software should not only function well but
          also be visually appealing and easy to navigate.Since then,
          I’ve immersed myself in the world of Java, exploring frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, and working on
          projects
          that challenge me to growIn addition to my technical skills, I believe in the importance of collaboration
          and
          effective communication
          in
          software development. I thrive in team environments where I can share ideas and learn from others.

          When I’m not coding, you can find me cooking delicious food, playing cricket and travelling with my friends
          and family. I’m excited about the future of technology and look forward to contributing to innovative
          projects
          in the software industry.
